Hello to all who are interested in deep learning and docker,

I found that there are already a few repositories containing docker images for deep learning, but so far I was not completely satisfied with any I could find. So I decided to start this repository for my personal purposes and if anybody finds it useful, feel free to use it. Without any warranty of course.

I wish you all nice day and enjoy the deep learning journey!
